.. specific_entity_data ..

Enti_header:
struct ENTI_header
{
	DWORD seq_id; // this is unique id for entities, every entity have it. it have non-linear behavior.
	DWORD ent_id; // this is entity id. In this game every entity splits into 2 groups. first is entities came
		      // from Asura engine, second is specific objects for this game. but its only assumption.
	// First group have normal entity_id. For second group ent_id is > 0x8000, to get normal id substract
	// 0x7FA5. There only 178 max number of entity id.
